#Plex Sandbox
The objective of this project is to connect to the Plex SQlite database and use that data to add notes, queue additional video(s) as well as expose/track what is currently available via web server.

Note: This project is not in a usuable state at this time but should be shortly. If interested in development, you can follow the project and I will modify this README once ready for Alpha.
